# chain-arrays

Logical concatenation for large arrays, in TypeScript (for copy-n-paste / no library):

 - Chain and process large arrays, without making any copies, for efficient memory use.

Just copy [chain-arrays.ts](./src/chain-arrays.ts) (or [chain-arrays.js](./src/chain-arrays.js)) file into your project, and you're good to go ðŸš€

Functions `chainArrays` and `chainArraysReverse` there are self-explanatory ðŸ˜‰

To run [./src/test.ts](./src/test.ts), install dependencies via `npm i`, and then do `npm test`.
